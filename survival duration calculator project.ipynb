    "Logic Used: This Python code calculates the duration of a person's life in different time units such as months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds based on their age. It employs the following logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "It retrieves the current date and time using the datetime module.\n",
    "The user provides their age as input.\n",
    "The code calculates the person's birth date by subtracting the age in years from the current date.\n",
    "The user selects a time unit (e.g., months) to calculate the duration.\n",
    "The code calculates and displays the duration in the chosen time unit, taking leap years into account.\n",
    "Functions Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "calculate_duration: This function computes the duration based on the selected time unit and age. It handles the conversion of years into months and considers leap years. It returns the calculated duration as a formatted string.\n",
    "get_time_unit_from_user: This function collects the user's choice of time unit, validates the input, and returns the chosen time unit as a string.\n",
    "Real-time Usage: This code is particularly useful for calculating how long a person has lived in different time units, providing flexibility for various applications such as age-related statistics, health tracking, or personal curiosity. Users can easily select their preferred time unit to obtain a more meaningful perspective on their age.\n",
